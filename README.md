# Cezanne
Cezanne is a platform that allows artists to publish and sell their artwork to the world. Visit at:[cezanne.com](http://cezanne.herokuapp.com)

    IMPORTANT: Authentication is still in development, to log in use any user and password.

### How it works?
Cezzane allows artists to upload their artwork to the platform and set a base price for it. Other users can bid for any artwork they wish, as long as the bid is higher than the base price or the highest bid at the moment. On the bid's closing date, the highest bidder will pay the full bid amount and take ownership of the artwork.

### How much Cezanne charges?
Cezanne will charge a 15% fee for every transaction. The remaining amount is for the artist.
